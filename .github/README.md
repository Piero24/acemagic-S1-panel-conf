# ACEMAGIC S1 Mini PC Front Panel Configuration

My Configuration of the Front Panel for the ACEMAGIC S1 Mini PC.
The ACEMAGIC S1 Mini PC allows configuration of the front display through software on Windows, enabling the display of various useful information and performance statistics. However, this program is not natively available on Linux. Thanks to the project [AceMagic-S1-LED-TFT-Linux](https://github.com/tjaworski/AceMagic-S1-LED-TFT-Linux/tree/main) created by [tjaworski](https://github.com/tjaworski), it is now possible to customize the display on Linux as well, using a web interface.

This guide provides the installation process I followed to set up the software on the S1, along with the configuration files used for the theme.

## Example Output

Below are examples of the output on the front panel of the ACEMAGIC S1 Mini PC.

<table align="center" cellpadding="10">
    <tr align="center" cellpadding="10">
        <td align="center">
            <img src="screen.png" alt="First Image" width="auto"/>
        </td>
        <td align="center" width="250">
            <img src="photo.png" alt="Second Image" width="auto"/>

## Installazione

1. Install Node Version Manager (NVM) as explained [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

2. Install Node.js and npm with the Required Versions (or above):
    
    ```bash
    nvm install 18.13.0
    ```
    Set this version as the default:

    ```bash
    nvm use 18.13.0
    ```

    ```bash
    npm install -g npm@9.2.0
    ```

3. Verify Node.js and npm Versions with sudo. Some commands may need to be run with sudo, so ensure the versions match when running with and without sudo:

    Check Node.js version with and without sudo:

    ```bash
    node -v
    sudo node -v
    ```
    
    Check npm version with and without sudo:

    ```bash
    npm -v
    sudo npm -v
    ```

4. Clone the Repository. Choose a directory where youâ€™d like to clone the project, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tjaworski/AceMagic-S1-LED-TFT-Linux.git acemagic
    ```
    This will create a folder named `acemagic` with the contents of the project.

5. Install the Project: Navigate to the project folder and run the installation script:

    ```bash
    cd acemagic/s1panel
    sudo ./install
    ```
    Ensure there are no errors during the installation process. The installation should complete with a success message similar to:

    <img src="success.png" alt="First Image" width="auto"/>

6. Verify the Server Status

    After installation, check if the service is running properly by check the status of the s1panel service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status s1panel
    ```
    
    If everything is working fine, you should see an output like this:

    <img src="status_ok.png" alt="First Image" width="auto"/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the service is not running, try following [these](https://github.com/Piero24/acemagic-S1-panel-conf/blob/main/.github/Error.md).

7. Next Step: Import Custom Themes and Configuration

If everything works as expected, you can proceed to the next step of importing custom themes and configuring the system.

## Importazione del tema custom

1. Stop the service as follows:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop s1panel
    ```
2. Replace the config file with the one on these repository and also add the themes folder:

    ```bash
    scp ~/Downloads/config.json USER-OF-THE-ACEMAGIC-S1@LOCAL-IP-OF-THE-ACEMAGIC-S1:~/acemagic/s1panel/config.json
    scp -r ~/Downloads/main USER-OF-THE-ACEMAGIC-S1@LOCAL-IP-OF-THE-ACEMAGIC-S1:~/acemagic/s1panel/themes
    ```
3. Start the service again:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart s1panel.service
    ```
